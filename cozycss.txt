I’ve also been surprised at how difficult this project was as well. Not sure I can answer any of your questions but interested to see other people’s solutions so thanks for sharing!

Currently on this guy too!! I am in a struggle with the featured tea section with weird wraps and what not I know I’m close to solving it. But trying to answer these questions lets see:

Sorry I don’t quite get your wording do you mean inside the Nav people are using li with nested links? Is that what you mean? I just looked at other websites and I noticed it was a convention and I figured well these folks are getting paid (hopefully) to do this so I’m just going to copy the convention. I also need to read back and figure out how to set up the nav. menu to refer to parts of the site. I think that might be also partially what you’re asking??

I’ve been making sections and using class on the section with dividers around the other elements

{html} but I added spaces because codebytes doesn’t support it /and to show you what I mean:

< section class=“featured”>
< div class= “tea”>
< p>whatevs< /p>
< /div>
< /section>

css:
. featured {
}
.tea {
}
.tea p {
}

that way I can make my css shorter and more readable…

you should be able to override by just setting the opacity to whatever you want or if you want more control remove it from your global styles at the beginning?? Yeah I know its not the red line brief but I’m not strictly following it either. Like the Nav styles I implemented don’t have the underline cause most links now don’t look like that…They sort of just look cool and floaty. I also nixed the one px the border. I added a different google font ect… I’m making this project my own

My guess is you probably shouldn’t have to hard code the px… I know it whomps but you might have to fiddle with the css or reorg the html to get it to working the way you want.

I’m not sure what you mean but if you want to make the footer visible maybe remove it from the flow of the document with fixed ?? I’m not sure what you mean. The footer should just be there hanging out so long as you set it up in your html. I’ve noticed it just contains the copyright in most. I added the contact section there. I might change that but sorry I can’t give you a better answer than that.

Not sure I was helpful. But I know writing through these things you can figure out stuff. I’ll post mine when it’s done which will at least maybe make my thoughts clearer than just plain ol’ English.

Also couldn’t find “tea cozy” tag for this project on forum. I want to share my solution for this. Actually don’t know how bad is it, but still want to share.
